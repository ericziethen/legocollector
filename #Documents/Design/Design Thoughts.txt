### Part Relatioship Analysis ###

    # CSV Line
    rel_type,child_part_num,parent_part_num
    A,50990b,50990a


    # Relationship Types (rel_type)
            rel_type,child_part_num,parent_part_num
    - A ->  A,50990b,50990a         -> Alternate Parts (of each other)
    - M ->  M,30361pr1,30361cpr1    -> Different Mold (30361pr1 Superseeded by 30361cpr1)
    - M ->  M,92950,3455            -> Different Mold (3455 Superseeded by 92950)
        -> Can't tell thich superseedes the other, just that they are the same
    - P ->  P,27382pr0005,27382     -> Prints (Child different print of Parent)
    - T ->  T,53547pat0001,53547    -> Pattern (Child different Pattern of Parent)

??? Are there any recursive Relationships ???
    e.g. A == B == C
    -> How to find all parts that should have the same relationship???
    -> Do we need a master part? Probably not since there is none.

    # Part Relationships Needed

    1.) Option 1 - Preferrable
        Table Part:
            child_relationship = ManyToMany('self', through='ChildPart', symmetrical=False)
            part_attributes = ForeignKey(PartAttributes)

        Table ChildPart:
            type (Enum, 4 types)

        Table PartAttributes
            attributes (multiple)

    2.) Option 2
        Table Part
            Nothing added for Relationship
            attribute

        Table PartRelationship
            child = ForeignKey(Part, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='part_children')
            parent = ForeignKey(Part, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='part_parents')
            type (Enum, 4 types)

        Table PartAttributes
            attributes (multiple)

    # Data Population
        1.) Import Relationships - Option 1
            for each relationship in separated file
                parentPart.setChild(childPart)
                parentPart.ChildPart.type = fileType

            -> At the end, we have all relationships set

        2.) Import Attributes
